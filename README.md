# Rick and Morty - App Context

The porpoise of this project is to show how to use the Context API in React and make some basic API calls to Rick and Morty API. I implemented a simple system of cards to show all the characters and a pagination in the app to show more characters. I implement as a state manager React Context API.

This simple application uses the following technologies:
- React
